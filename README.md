# 👋 Hi, I'm To Trong Nhan  
**Backend Software Engineer**

I’m a backend-focused software engineer with strong experience in **Java (Spring Framework)** and **Python (Django Framework)**.  
I also have solid knowledge of **JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Next.js, React Native, and TailwindCSS**, but my passion and main strength remain in backend and system design.

I love building reliable systems, writing clean code, and constantly learning new technologies.  
Currently, I’m **looking for new opportunities** as a Backend Engineer or Software Engineer.
